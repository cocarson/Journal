Journal
=======

A simple journal app that I use to keep track of my days.

Journal is a fairly straight forward journaling application. All CRUD operations are supported. I may add more organization and search features in the future. The app is built on Meteor.js.

This project was coded from scratch and was not a walk through tutorial.
